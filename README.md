# DocumentAI
This is a WIP machine reading application, intended to be used to scan certificates of insurances, policies, and declaration pages.
It should find key phrases, policy numbers, etc. and output an accurate compliance report. This output will either be manually entered into a secondary software, or automated as the project progresses.
